<p>
8. I then privately edited "Blob" text file within the Azure storage container. This shows the functionality of using Azure storage containers to privately edit various file types.

9. Below is a screenshot of the text file in its different states. The above state shows the file with contents edited in Windows outside of the Azure storage container. The below state of the file shows it after it has been edited privately within the Azure storage container and then downloaded onto the local windows system.

10. After having successfully executed the functions of creating a resource group, storage container within that resource group, and then downloading the contents located within the storage container onto my local machine, I proceeded to delete the resource group and any resources contained within it.
